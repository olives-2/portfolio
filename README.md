This repo contains my portfolio website, made with SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.

## Run locally

To run the site locally, install `yarn`:

`npm install -G yarn`

Install the dependencies:

`yarn install`

Then, run the script:

`yarn run dev`

## Deploy

To deploy the site (if anyone else than me ever can...), run:

`yarn run deploy`

This will use the static SvelteKit adapter and use gh-actions to deploy the site.
